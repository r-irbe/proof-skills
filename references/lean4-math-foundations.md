## Part 1 — Lean's Logical Foundations

### 1.1 Type Universe Hierarchy

```
Sort 0 = Prop          -- propositions (proof-irrelevant)
Sort 1 = Type 0 = Type -- computational types
Sort 2 = Type 1        -- types of types
Sort (n+1) = Type n    -- cumulative hierarchy
```

**Project relevance:** All Project theorem statements live in `Prop`. Definitions of structures (e.g., `PhaseState`, `SafetyEnvelope`) live in `Type`. Metaprogramming (Qq quotations) may require universe-polymorphism awareness.

### 1.2 Classical vs Constructive

Lean + Mathlib is **classical by default** (via `Classical.choice`, `propext`, `Quot.sound`).

| Axiom | What it gives | Project usage |
|---|---|---|
| `propext` | Propositions with same truth value are equal | Set extensionality |
| `Quot.sound` | Quotient types respect equivalence | Quotient structures |
| `Classical.choice` | Every nonempty type has an element | Proof by contradiction, `Decidable` instances |
| `funext` | Pointwise equal functions are equal | Function extensionality (theorem, not axiom) |

**Guideline:** Use classical reasoning freely — Project is not a constructive project. But `#print axioms` must never show `sorryAx`.

### 1.3 Prop vs Decidable

```lean
-- Prop: a proposition (truth value, no computational content)
-- Decidable: a proposition with a decision procedure
-- In Project: finite, bounded Nat comparisons are always Decidable
-- Use `decide` for any goal that's computationally checkable

-- Pattern: when Lean says "failed to synthesize Decidable instance"
-- Either provide the instance or use Classical.dec
instance : Decidable (someComplexProp) := by
  unfold someComplexProp
  infer_instance  -- or: exact Classical.dec _
```

## Part 2 — Set Theory in Mathlib

### 2.1 Key Namespaces

| Namespace | Content | Project usage |
|---|---|---|
| `Set` | Sets as `α → Prop` | Quality gate domains, phase regions |
| `Set.Icc`, `Set.Ico`, etc. | Intervals `[a,b]`, `[a,b)`, etc. | Bounded score ranges, simplex constraints |
| `Finset` | Finite sets with decidable membership | Finite enumerations, gate conditions |
| `Multiset` | Unordered collections with multiplicity | (Rare in the project) |

### 2.2 Common Patterns

```lean
-- Membership in an interval
example (h : x ∈ Set.Icc (0:ℝ) 1) : 0 ≤ x := h.1
example (h : x ∈ Set.Icc (0:ℝ) 1) : x ≤ 1 := h.2

-- Set operations
example : Set.Icc 0 1 ∩ Set.Icc 0.5 1.5 = Set.Icc 0.5 1 := by ext; simp; constructor <;> intro ⟨h1, h2⟩ <;> omega

-- Finite set decidability
example : (3 : ℕ) ∈ ({1, 2, 3, 4} : Finset ℕ) := by decide
```

### 2.3 Simplex as Set

the project's trust simplex and CCV components live on simplices:

```lean
-- The standard simplex in the project (Nat-scaled)
def SimplexNat100 := { v : Fin 3 → ℕ | v 0 + v 1 + v 2 = 100 }

-- Real simplex for analysis
def SimplexReal := { v : Fin 3 → ℝ | (∀ i, 0 ≤ v i) ∧ ∑ i, v i = 1 }
```

## Part 3 — Algebraic Hierarchies (Mathlib Typeclasses)

### 3.1 The Algebra Tower

```
Mul → Semigroup → Monoid → Group
Add → AddSemigroup → AddMonoid → AddGroup
                          ↓
                    CommMonoid → CommGroup
                          ↓
              Semiring → Ring → CommRing → Field
                          ↓
              OrderedSemiring → OrderedRing → LinearOrderedField
                                                    ↓
                                                    ℝ
```

**Project relevance:** `ℕ` is an `OrderedSemiring`. `ℝ` is a `LinearOrderedField`. Proofs that work for `ℝ` often need `OrderedField` or `LinearOrder` hypotheses.

### 3.2 Common Typeclass Patterns

```lean
-- Working with ordered structures
example [OrderedSemiring α] (a b c : α) (hab : a ≤ b) (hc : 0 ≤ c) :
    a * c ≤ b * c := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right hab hc

-- Lattice operations (for Project severity lattice)
example [Lattice α] (a b : α) : a ⊔ b = b ⊔ a := sup_comm a b

-- Linear order (for threshold comparisons)
example [LinearOrder α] (a b : α) : a ≤ b ∨ b ≤ a := le_total a b
```

### 3.3 Project-specific Algebraic Structures

| Project concept | Algebraic structure | Mathlib typeclass |
|---|---|---|
| Quality scores (Nat ×100) | Bounded ordered monoid | `OrderedAddCommMonoid` |
| Phase severity | Total order with 4 elements | `LinearOrder` + `Fintype` |
| Trust vector | Simplex (convex subset of ℝ³) | `Convex ℝ` |
| Pipeline composition | Monoid of transformations | `Monoid` |
| Stochastic matrix | Row-stochastic `Matrix` | `StochMatrix` (custom) |

---

## Part 4 — Order Theory

### 4.1 Key Structures

| Structure | Definition | Typical project usage |
|---|---|---|
| `Preorder` | Reflexive + transitive | (Rarely needed directly) |
| `PartialOrder` | + antisymmetric | General ≤ infrastructure |
| `LinearOrder` | Total order | Threshold comparisons |
| `Lattice` | Sup + inf | See `lean-math-discrete` §3 for applied lattices |
| `CompleteLattice` | Arbitrary sup/inf | (Lyapunov sublevel sets) |
| `BoundedOrder` | Has ⊤ and ⊥ | Bounded score types |
| `WellFoundedRelation` | No infinite descending chains | Induction on DAGs, provenance depth |

Applied / project lattice instances (severity lattices, gate
composition, quality-gate lattice, trust-vector componentwise order,
information-flow security levels) are owned by
[`lean-math-discrete §3 Lattice Theory`](../lean-math-discrete/SKILL.md).
This file keeps only the typeclass tower.

### 4.2 Monotonicity

Project monotonicity theorems use:

```lean
-- Monotone: preserves ≤
theorem gate_monotone : Monotone gateFunction := by
  intro a b hab
  unfold gateFunction
  omega  -- or linarith for ℝ

-- StrictMono: preserves <
-- Antitone: reverses ≤
-- StrictAnti: reverses <
```

### 4.3 Fixed Points

Knaster-Tarski (lattice fixed points) and Banach (metric / contraction
fixed points) are consolidated into:

- Lattice side: `Mathlib.Order.FixedPoints` —
  `CompleteLattice.fixedPoint_lfp`, `CompleteLattice.fixedPoint_gfp`.
- Metric / contraction side: see
  [`references/lean4-contraction-catalog.md`](../../references/lean4-contraction-catalog.md)
  for the full `ContractingWith` API, geometric-decay lemma, and
  project contraction-theorem index.

## Part 5 — Logic and Proof Techniques

### 5.1 Proof Methods Cheat Sheet

| Goal shape | Primary tactic | Alternatives |
|---|---|---|
| `P ∧ Q` | `constructor` then prove each | `exact ⟨hp, hq⟩` |
| `P ∨ Q` | `left` / `right` | `exact Or.inl hp` |
| `P → Q` | `intro h` | `fun h => ...` |
| `¬P` | `intro h; exact absurd ...` | `by_contra` |
| `∀ x, P x` | `intro x` | |
| `∃ x, P x` | `exact ⟨witness, proof⟩` | `use witness` |
| `P ↔ Q` | `constructor <;> intro h` | `Iff.intro ...` |
| `a = b` | `rfl` / `ext` / `ring` / `omega` | `calc ...` |
| `a ≤ b` | `omega` / `linarith` / `nlinarith` | `gcongr` |
| `a < b` | `omega` / `linarith` | `lt_of_le_of_lt` |
| Decidable | `decide` (**`native_decide` BANNED** — adds `Lean.trustCompiler`; zero uses in the project) | |
| By contradiction | `by_contra h` | `absurd` |
| Case split | `rcases` / `obtain` / `match` | `cases` |

### 5.2 Induction Patterns

```lean
-- Simple natural number induction
theorem pow_pos (n : ℕ) (h : 0 < base) : 0 < base ^ n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => simp
  | succ k ih => exact mul_pos ih h

-- Strong induction
theorem strong_example (n : ℕ) : P n := by
  induction n using Nat.strong_rec_on with
  | _ n ih => ...

-- Well-founded induction (on DAGs, trees)
theorem wf_example (h : WellFounded r) : ... := by
  exact WellFounded.fix h (fun x ih => ...)

-- Structural induction on inductive types
theorem phase_exhaustive (p : PhaseType) : P p := by
  cases p <;> simp [...]
```

### 5.3 Project Proof Architecture Patterns

| Pattern | When to use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `have` chain | Build intermediate facts | Simplex arithmetic (`have hk : tK = 100 - tR - tS`) |
| `calc` block | Step-by-step equality/inequality | Lyapunov decay chain |
| `suffices` | Prove a stronger statement first | Generalize before instantiate |
| `convert` | Goal is "almost" matched by a lemma | Type coercion bridges |
| `push_neg` | Negate quantifiers | Counterexample construction |

## Part 6 — Category Theory Basics

### 6.1 When Category Theory Appears in the project

- **Functorial structure** of pipeline composition (transformations between stages)
- **Monoidal categories** underlying the trust simplex operations
- **Diagrams** in provenance chains (DAG as a category)

### 6.2 Mathlib Category Theory

```lean
import Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Category.Basic
import Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Functor.Basic

-- Most Project work does NOT need explicit category theory.
-- The algebraic hierarchy (monoids, lattices) suffices.
-- Category theory is needed only if:
--   1. Formalizing functorial properties of pipeline transformations
--   2. Proving naturality of phase transitions
--   3. Working with enriched categories (e.g., metric spaces as enriched)
```

**Guideline:** Do not reach for category theory unless the theorem genuinely requires it. Prefer concrete algebraic structures.
